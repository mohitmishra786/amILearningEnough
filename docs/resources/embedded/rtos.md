# Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS): Complete Learning Guide

## Overview
Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) provide deterministic, time-critical task scheduling and resource management for embedded systems. Unlike general-purpose operating systems, RTOS guarantees predictable response times and handles concurrent tasks with precise timing requirements.

The learning path: **Bare Metal Foundation → RTOS Fundamentals → Commercial RTOS → Linux Real-Time → Advanced RTOS Development**.
